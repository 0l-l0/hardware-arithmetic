# Bitonic network
Bitonic sorter networks implement a parallel sorting algorithm known as the
[bitonic mergesort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter). It utilize
the special ascending-descending property of _bitonic_ sequences. To guarantee
this property for every subsequence we use two types of comparators (or a
switchable comparator in our case). One that outputs the smaller then the larger
one of its inputs and one that works in the opposite way.

The core of the bitonic network is the connection structure. An easily
generalizable pattern of such sorter networks can be seen on the
[bitonic sorter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter) Wikipedia page.
In this VHDL implementation we build a network capable of sorting a sequence
of eight numbers.

The `sort_test.vhd` file contains an example unsorted sequence for testing and,
of course, the necessary test entity.
